                <h1>ENIGMA</h1>
                <h4>To be an enigma means seeing something with your heart thatâ€™s invisible to your eyes</h4>
                <p>
                    Our seniors walked this talk with the initiation of Enigma- an Inter-house competition in 2013, for
                    students from classes one to eleven, giving them a spectrum beyond the spine of their books and
                    scribbling of pencils into a world of fun to exercise their skillset. An event exclusively designed
                    by our alumni that cherishes the creativity of the orchids in this petite garden and nurture it into
                    a shrubbery. This has left a golden mark on the annual calendars of National Hill View Public School
                    and is something that has imprinted enthusiastic anticipation in the minds of the students. With the
                    ticking of time, students of class 12 have come up with ground-breaking and artistic events
                    organized to recreate enigma with a tinge of ingenuity and the motive of curiosity, creativity and
                    the spirit of healthy competition. <br>
                    The time has finally arrived when we can switch from the mundane walls of our home to the vibrancy
                    that our school campus and peers offer us. Enigma 2022 is going a notch higher by encapsulating team
                    work and collaboration like sand and sea especially after being confined to our own company for the
                    past two years which has helped us grow as individuals. However, folks now is the time to come
                    together in person, as a team and give this cooperative teamwork with our school mates a new
                    pedestal.
                    <br>
                    We look forward to your active participation to make it memorable for all of us!
                    Wishing all the participants the best of luck and hoping to see you all in the upcoming events
                </p>
